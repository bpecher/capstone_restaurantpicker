# Project Title: Restaurant Picker Capstone Project

## Team Members: Devin Sprinkle, Joe Green, Brandon Pecher, Emmet Quint

### About:

Restaurant picker is an application for Windows that chooses a restaurant for an user based on the location of that user. It is a simple and streamlined application that is being coded in the C# language. The target audience would be users that are looking for a quick and easy list of nearby restaurants to decide where to eat. If the user is indecisive, there is an option for the application to select or recommend a random restaurant near the user. We intend to include reviews, names, and addresses of the restaurants as well as a history of prior selected restaurants.

### Installation:

This application is designed for use with Windows. It will be planned to be released as an executable file with a .exe file extension that can be downloaded and then launched within the Windows OS. The software does rely on a Yelp API and a Google Maps API, so Internet access will be required to utilize the application. The API have rate limits, so the number of requests in an allotted amount of time are restrcted by the API utilized for the application. It should require .NET Framework 4.5 or higher as well. The project is being coded in a version of Microsoft Visual Studio like 2022.
